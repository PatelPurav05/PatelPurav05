# Hi, I'm Purav

I'm the cofounder of [PUG](https://getpug.dev), a tool built to make documentation  effortless for developers, while solving the LLM context problem for large, legacy codebases. We started it because we were frustrated watching AI hallucinate during upgrades, and even more frustrated with how much time teams spend documenting things.

## What Iâ€™m Working On

- Building PUG to help developers generate meaningful documentation right from their IDE.
- Designing upgrade guides that actually reflect how your codebase needs to change.
- Creating guardrails that help AI tools like Cursor avoid breaking things.
- Talking to users, learning from how they work, and improving fast.

## Reach Out

Always open to thoughtful conversations around dev tools, AI, product design, and systems that scale. If you're building something in the space, or want to collaborate, feel free to reach out.
