# Hi, I'm Purav

I'm the cofounder of [PUG](https://getpug.dev), a tool built to make documentation and upgrade workflows effortless for developers. We started it because we were frustrated watching AI hallucinate during upgrades, and even more frustrated with how much time teams spend documenting things they already know.

My focus is on building tools that are fast, reliable, and respectful of a developer’s time. I care deeply about product clarity, context-aware systems, and making sure what we build actually gets used — not just shipped.

## What I’m Working On

- Building PUG to help developers generate meaningful documentation right from their IDE.
- Designing upgrade guides that actually reflect how real codebases evolve — not just diff logs.
- Creating guardrails that help AI tools like Cursor avoid breaking things.
- Talking to users, learning from how they work, and improving fast.

## What I Believe

- The best tools disappear into the workflow.
- Velocity matters, but only if it’s pointed in the right direction.
- Great documentation starts with understanding what matters to your team — and what doesn’t.
- AI is only useful if it understands your context. That’s what we’re fixing.
